Datasets
========

The datasets module provides a streamlined approach to accessing and utilizing various datasets for computational imaging tasks. The central module is the `CustomDataset` class, an abstraction designed to facilitate easy selection and handling of datasets from a predefined collection.

Dataset Class
-------------

The `CustomDataset` class serves as a flexible interface for accessing builtin datasets and custom datasets. Using the `CustomDataset` class, researchers and developers can swiftly navigate through the available datasets, simplifying the process of dataset selection and loading. This abstraction layer ensures that users can focus on their computational imaging tasks without worrying about the underlying data handling intricacies.
