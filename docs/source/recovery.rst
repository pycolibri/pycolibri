Recovery
========

The recovery module provides an implementation of state-of-the-art recovery algorithms widely used 
in image restoration on inverse problems.

.. math::

    \min_{x} f(\mathbf{x})+ \lambda g(\mathbf{x})

where :math:`f(\mathbf{x})` is the fidelity term and :math:`g(\mathbf{x})` is the prior term.
